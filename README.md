## Features

- **Real-time Temperature Monitoring**: Measures ambient temperature with hardware compensation for CPU heat
- **Humidity Tracking**: Monitors relative humidity percentage
- **Web Dashboard**: Clean, responsive web interface automatically refreshes every 60 seconds
- **API Endpoints**: JSON data access for integration with other monitoring systems
- **LED Display**: Shows current temperature on the Sense HAT LED matrix
- **Logging**: Records all measurements to a log file

## Hardware Requirements

- Raspberry Pi (Zero 2 W or other model)
- Sense HAT add-on board
- Power supply
- (Optional) Case for the Raspberry Pi

## Installation

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install required system packages
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip python3-sense-hat

# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install Python dependencies
pip install flask
```

### Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/temp_monitor.git
   cd temp_monitor
   ```

2. Configure log file location:
   Edit the `temp_monitor.py` file to update the log file path if needed:
   ```python
   logging.basicConfig(
       filename='/home/yourusername/temp_monitor.log',
       level=logging.INFO,
       format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
   )
   ```

3. (Optional) Add a custom logo:
   Place your image file at the location specified in the code:
   ```python
   with open("/home/yourusername/logo.gif", "rb") as image_file:
   ```

4. Set up as a service (for automatic startup):
   Create a systemd service file:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/temp_monitor.service
   ```
   
   Add the following content:
   ```
   [Unit]
   Description=Temperature Monitor Service
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   User=yourusername
   WorkingDirectory=/home/yourusername/temp_monitor
   ExecStart=/home/yourusername/temp_monitor/venv/bin/python3 temp_monitor.py
   Restart=always
   RestartSec=10

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

   Enable and start the service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable temp_monitor.service
   sudo systemctl start temp_monitor.service
   ```

## Usage

### Web Dashboard

Access the web dashboard by navigating to:
```
http://[raspberry-pi-ip-address]:8080
```

The dashboard will automatically refresh every 60 seconds.

### API Endpoints

#### Temperature and Humidity Data
```
GET http://[raspberry-pi-ip-address]:8080/api/temp
```

Returns:
```json
{
  "temperature_c": 23.5,
  "temperature_f": 74.3,
  "humidity": 45.2,
  "timestamp": "2023-09-19 14:23:45"
}
```

#### Raw Sensor Data (for debugging)
```
GET http://[raspberry-pi-ip-address]:8080/api/raw
```

Returns:
```json
{
  "cpu_temperature": 54.2,
  "raw_temperature": 32.6,
  "compensated_temperature": 23.5,
  "humidity": 45.2,
  "timestamp": "2023-09-19 14:23:45"
}
```

## Temperature Compensation

The system compensates for the effect of CPU heat on temperature readings using a formula:
```
compensated_temp = raw_temp - ((cpu_temp - raw_temp) * factor)
```
Where `factor` is a calibration value (default 0.7) that may need adjustment based on your specific hardware configuration and enclosure.

## Customization

### Sampling Interval

To change how often temperature readings are updated, modify the `sampling_interval` variable (in seconds):

```python
sampling_interval = 60  # seconds between temperature updates
```

### Web Interface

The web interface uses an embedded HTML template with CSS. You can customize the appearance by modifying the HTML template in the `index()` function.

## Troubleshooting

- **Sense HAT not detected**: Ensure the HAT is properly connected and that I2C is enabled (use `sudo raspi-config`)
- **Web interface not accessible**: Check that port 8080 is not blocked by a firewall
- **Inaccurate temperature**: Adjust the compensation factor in the `get_compensated_temperature()` function

# Temperature Monitor API with Bearer Token Authentication

This application monitors temperature and humidity using a Raspberry Pi with Sense HAT and provides a web interface and API endpoints to access the data.

## API Security

The API endpoints are protected with Bearer Token authentication. You need to include a valid token in the `Authorization` header to access the API.

## Getting Started

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Generate a bearer token:
   ```
   python generate_token.py
   ```
   This will create a secure random token and save it to the `.env` file.

3. Start the application:
   ```
   python temp_monitor.py
   ```

## Using the API

To access the API endpoints, include the bearer token in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" http://your-server:8080/api/temp
```

### Available Endpoints

- `/api/temp` - Get current temperature and humidity data
- `/api/raw` - Get raw temperature data (including CPU temperature)
- `/api/verify-token` - Verify if your token is valid
- `/api/generate-token` - Generate a new token (requires existing valid token)

## Regenerating Tokens

You can regenerate the token in two ways:

1. Using the script:
   ```
   python generate_token.py
   ```

2. Using the API (requires existing valid token):
   ```
   curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CURRENT_TOKEN" http://your-server:8080/api/generate-token
   ```

## Security Notes

- Keep your bearer token secure and don't share it publicly
- The token is stored in the `.env` file, which should be kept private
- Consider regenerating the token periodically for enhanced security
